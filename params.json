In that time I have used Perl, PHP, JavaScript, Scheme and now focus on Erlang.\r\n\r\nMy tools of choice include Erlang, WebMachine, QuickCheck, Dialyzer, Erlog and Lager (and others). For me Erlang provides the right mix of Rock Solid Stability and ease of development.\r\n\r\nIn addition I have also been involved in the wider Erlang community by writing the Book \"Building Web Applications With Erlang\", hosting the Mostly Erlang Podcast, Speaking at conferences and work on a few open source projects.","google":"UA-59025600-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
